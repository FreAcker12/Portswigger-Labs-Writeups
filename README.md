# 🛡️ PortSwigger Labs – Complete Writeups & Solutions

Welcome to this repository!  
Here you’ll find a full collection of writeups, notes, and solution approaches for **all 270 (current) PortSwigger labs**.  

The goal of this project is to help security enthusiasts, bug bounty hunters, and penetration testers learn **how to approach, analyze, and solve every single PortSwigger lab** in a structured way.

- ✅ Step-by-step **writeups** for each lab  
- ✅ My **personal methodology** and thought process  
- ✅ Multiple approaches where applicable (not just one solution)  
- ✅ Organized structure so you can easily navigate between labs

Each lab has its own folder containing:
- **writeup.md** → detailed solution steps  
- **payloads.txt** → tested payloads
- **automation.py** → Code used to automate the lab/solve the lab
- **screenshots/** → supporting images

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Pick a lab folder.  
2. Read the `writeup.md` for methodology.  
3. Try replicating the steps yourself.  
4. Compare with my approach and improve your skills.
